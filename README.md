For specific version:

	pod "DRForms", :git => "https://github.com/darrarski/DRFormattedNumberTextField-iOS", :branch => "VERSION_BRANCH"

Where `VERSION_BRANCH` you should put the branch name for given version (ex. "v1.x"). It is recommended to set version branch explicity, as backward compatibility between those branches is not warranted. Master branch always contains the most recent version.
